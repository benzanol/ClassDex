    "description" : "Taught in the Spring, Literary Editing & Publishing\/The Rice Review is the second course recommended to students desiring practical skills in the fields of literary editing and publishing. Experiential in nature, this class engages students in the real considerations and hands-on experience of publishing Rice’s nationally award-winning undergraduate literary journal, The Rice Review. Enrolled students will participate in weekly editorial meetings to read and discuss the merits of undergraduate submissions across literature’s three main genres: poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction. Students will discuss a diverse group of submissions in the workshop setting, refine their editorial skills through written critiques, and enlarge their understanding of the editing process. Later in the term, students will become proficient with Adobe's InDesign layout software and create final magazine spreads that demonstrate an attention to the interplay of text and image. Students will also be asked to become practitioners of “literary citizenship.” This will come about through participation at outside literary events and through the hands-on experience of planning and hosting The Rice Review’s Spring Launch Event. All students will be considered official staffers for the magazine and will be acknowledged in that year’s annual issue. Course counts towards the English Creative Writing Major Concentration (ECRW) and the Minor in Creative Writing.\nIn order to control course demand, registration is by permission of the instructor. Please reach out to ianschimmel@rice.edu to register or with inquiries.\nThere is no prerequisite for this course, but a joy for reading and debating the qualities of great poetry and prose is strongly encouraged.\nENGL 113 is a prerequisite for ENGL 114, or permission from the instructor is required.",

    "description" : "In the late ’60s, the question of color photography came into focus. Wrestling with the previous generation of artists who only took black and white seriously, the young artists started using color film and revolutionized the language of photography. Our class will start here, starting by understanding this new language in prominent formalist theories during that time. We will then move forward in time and look at the works of preceding artists, who narrate through that language, utilizing it for personal and political ends. By the end of the course, you will gain skills to analyze photographs you encounter everywhere — from those in news articles to those in gallery shows. You will also have a comprehensive understanding of how photography can be used for artistic means, and how are those photographs distinguished from photographic materials we encounter every day.",

    "description" : "Marketing is evolving from an art to a science as data is now the key source of decision making. In this course students learn how to use data analytics to address decisions by marketing managers, with emphasis on pricing and promotion. Students will understand how different types of data can—or cannot—be used to answer managerial questions and how better planning can simplify the analytics and increase confidence in the findings. The course is organized around a hierarchy of topics. We begin with understanding pricing and promoting to an individual customer. We then move to more aggregate decisions, such as setting regular and promoted prices at the product level, managing category pricing, and store analytics. This course is practical and hands-on, analyzing data from real-world managerial problems, through collaborations with leading retailers and consulting firms. Working knowledge of statistics (e.g., t-test and regression analysis) is required. Students learn and use R for data analysis; no prior experience with R is necessary. The goal is not to train students to become experts in statistics or computer science; rather, students will learn to become a bridge between data scientists and managers.",

The first part of the course will present an economic analysis of the costs and benefits of using different types of policies to control emissions from fossil fuel use. The remainder of the course, taught from a practitioner's perspective, will discuss the interrelationship between science, institutions and politics when designing environmental policy. The focus will be on problems associated with oil and gas production - especially water contamination and use - and hazardous waste disposal."

By considering the role Black anthropologists have played as ethnographic knowledge producers, rather than simply ethnographic objects, this seminar considers not how race has shaped the study of culture. In addressing the discipline's legacy of anti-Blackness in the study of \"cultural difference,\" this class considers how Black anthropologists have drawn on concepts and theories within Black Studies to reimagine and rewrite their own genealogy within the discipline. From Du Boisian political economy of racism and Black feminist poetics and performance to contemporary discussions of decolonizing and abolitionist anthropology, this course addresses how Black anthropologists have created ethnographic approaches that not only redress disciplinary anti-Black racism, but also, most importantly, provide approaches studying the robustness of Black life.

Students will explore line, contour, tone, space, form, composition, and content through a variety of portrait assignments in dry and wet media including pencil, charcoal, and oil paint. Through discussions and readings, students will also learn how humans recognize faces, why humans have evolved to look different, and the history of portraiture and its prevalence in society. Students will learn to understand and employ spatial and depth perception cues and mathematical approximations in drawing. Students will gradually learn how to draw portraits from both photographs and live models and dip their toes into the art of caricature. Students will learn the technical aspects of portrait making and will be given freedom to develop and explore their own individual style. No prior experience in drawing is required but recommended.\"",

    "description" : "This course offers an introduction to design anthropology in theory and practice. Design anthropology is a fast-developing interdisciplinary field that incorporates concepts, research methods and creative practices drawn from design and anthropology. Design anthropology draws upon anthropological insights into social relations and cultural forms in order to challenge expert-defined design practices with more collaborative and contextually sensitive processes of design co-creation. In the first half of this seminar, we will explore the history of social design and how anthropological culture theory and its insights into the interpretation of meaning (e.g., Geertz) have directly impacted practices of social design. We will also explore how design’s concern with innovation and futurity has attracted interest from public anthropologists interested not only in analyzing the world as it stands but also changing it for the better. In the second half of the course, the seminar will incorporate studio exercises where students will work in teams to practice social design skills through public-engaged projects to identify problems that are susceptible to social design solutions. Cross-list: ANTH 461.  Recommended Prerequisite(s): There are no specific prerequisites for this course. However, introductory level familiarity with anthropological theory and practice will be helpful. Design skills will also be useful, although are not required since the seminar’s focus will be on design ideation. Mutually Exclusive: Cannot register for ANTH 661 if student has credit for ANTH 461.",

The overarching goal of this class is three-fold. First, to understand the structure of the US food system and the ways that it is shaped by forms of power rooted in inequalities of race, class, and gender. Second, the course will introduce students to the concept of food justice and some of the key struggles of the food justice movement in the United States, as understood through lenses of land, labor, and agriculture. Third, students will draw from their structural understanding and exposure to varied critical perspectives to envision more just food futures and articulate these through a final project.",

It is used in cultures all around the world for celebration, self-expression, and even health purposes. Today, henna is everywhere, with Rihanna’s henna-inspired tattoo, the rise in TikTok fame of henna freckles, and festival goers decorating their bodies with temporary henna tattoos. What makes participating in this art form from a different culture cultural appreciation versus appropriation? How can we be mindful of this difference while creating art with henna?\nIn this course you will learn the art of henna, from how to hold a henna cone to how to create shapes and patterns to how to put all of it together and create a design. Along the way, you will also learn the history behind the art and how it is used in different cultures through various sources including instructional videos, blog posts from henna artists, historical sources that talk about henna, and scholarly analyses of henna designs. At the end of this class, you will create their own henna design, incorporating some of the designs and shapes we use in class, and reflect on the meaning of their piece, both culturally and personally.\"\"\"",

    "description" : "This course will overview both traditional and more recent graph-based machine learning\nalgorithms. Graphs show up in machine learning in many forms. Oftentimes, the input data can be naturally represented as a graph, such as for relational learning tasks applied to social\nnetworks and graph kernels applied to chemical data. Other times, graphs are just a framework to express some intrinsic structure in the data, such as for graphical models and non-linear\nembedding. In both cases, recent advances in representation learning (or graph embedding)\nand deep learning have generated a renewed interest in machine learning on graphs. At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to: (1) identify the appropriate graph-based machine learning algorithm for a given problem; (2) extend existing algorithms to solve new related problems; and (3) recognize some of the key research challenges in the field. The\ncourse will be a mixture of lectures, a research paper presentation, homework assignments\n(including programming), and a hands-on class project. Cross-list: COMP 559.

The healthcare industry represents a staggering 18.3% of gross domestic product, with little signs of abating in the future. With this growth comes a plethora of new opportunities for professionals seeking to make a positive difference in their communities. According to the National Bureau of Labor Statistics, the health industry will add approximately 1.8 million jobs annually through 2032. Openings are projected to outpace the average job growth across most American industries, underscoring the need for more individuals to consider a future career in health. Indeed, this growth is expected to touch upon nearly all sectors of the healthcare market, giving individuals a wide array of potential options for employment. This practicum class will provide students with perspectives that bridge current research with practical healthcare work experience. It will provide an overview of some of the challenges healthcare leaders face navigating the current industry. The class will expand upon how healthcare work can positively impact a student's community. Students will be encouraged to share their unique viewpoints as they work with healthcare professionals throughout the semester. They will also shape their future goals as they consider joining a healthcare-related business, government agency, or nonprofit organization. Further, students will be asked to share ideas on expanding healthcare access to cover more individuals. Students will also be asked to apply academic course materials to the knowledge gained through their practicum placement.",

In this course, we will work through the ways in which we can materialize a three-dimensional one. Students will use various technologies and materials including, the artist's body and plaster, to perform ideas and offer an understanding of a lived experience.

This course proposes to document the role of literature, painting, popular music, and, especially, cinema have played in memorializing our shared dread over not just the human body’s failures, but also their treatment. While primarily focused on the American twentieth century, this course will begin in Romantic-era Britain with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, and will culminate in the very-recent past with Jordan Peele’s Get Out. Along the way, we will attend to the 70s slasher film, the work of body horror’s cinematic dean, David Cronenberg, Japanese cyberpunk, extreme metal and grindcore lyrics, the paintings of Lucien Freud and Francis Bacon, high postmodern literature, any many more texts. We will propose to ask what these narratives can tell us about why we fear the body & its dangers, as well as how that anxiety has changed over time, both in response to changing medical\/surgical technology and other developments. These questions will in turn find us asking whether the horrors of embodiment and medicine are inflected by the specificities of the body in question—axes, that is to say, of gender, sex, sexuality, race, and ability. Is there a reason why the overwhelming majority of directors working in medical horror are straight white men? Do depictions of medical aberrations stage and exorcise fears about the otherness about the nonwhite, queer, or female body? Do they enact sadistic fantasies of seeing into—and possibly destroying—these bodies? This course counts towards the elective requirements for the MDHM minor.",

In particular, those robots which can physically interact with the world possess essential skills, called manipulation, to engage themselves more comprehensively in the real-world tasks. For example, robots with manipulation skills can help us in factories, kitchens, hospitals, warehouses, constructions sites, and even in space or on another planet. This course will introduce both fundamental and the state-of-the-art knowledge that enable robots to manipulate in our world. Topics including robot motions, kinematics, dynamics, simulation and ROS, hand and grasping, prehensile and nonprehensile manipulation, robot control, and interactive estimation, will be covered. Significant programming projects are involved to facilitate converting the textbook knowledge to solid hands-on experiences. Cross-list: COMP 562.

    "description" : "This course offers an introduction to design anthropology in theory and practice. Design anthropology is a fast-developing interdisciplinary field that incorporates concepts, research methods and creative practices drawn from design and anthropology. Design anthropology draws upon anthropological insights into social relations and cultural forms in order to challenge expert-defined design practices with more collaborative and contextually sensitive processes of design co-creation. In the first half of this seminar, we will explore the history of social design and how anthropological culture theory and its insights into the interpretation of meaning (e.g., Geertz) have directly impacted practices of social design. We will also explore how design’s concern with innovation and futurity has attracted interest from public anthropologists interested not only in analyzing the world as it stands but also changing it for the better. In the second half of the course, the seminar will incorporate studio exercises where students will work in teams to practice social design skills through public-engaged projects to identify problems that are susceptible to social design solutions. Cross-list: ANTH 661.  Recommended Prerequisite(s): There are no specific prerequisites for this course. However, introductory level familiarity with anthropological theory and practice will be helpful. Design skills will also be useful, although are not required since the seminar’s focus will be on design ideation.

Using the Faust narrative as our thread, we will chart the breadth of Goethe's thought. Throughout our journey we will confront questions concerning economics, politics, meaning, religion, and the best way to live, among so much more. Through investigating what Faust reveals about Goethe, we will reflect on what Faust reveals about our struggles with the challenge of being human. Our journey will conclude through a reflection on how Faust has been reflected on stage and in modern cinematic media. Through this we will consider the legacy and relevance of the text today, and be left with our own profound and timeless lessons. This class is for anyone, from any major or academic background, interested in the fundamental and perennial questions of human existence.",

    "description" : "There is a long history of algorithmic development for solving inferential and estimation problems that play a central role in a variety of learning, sensing, and processing systems, including medical imaging scanners, numerous machine learning algorithms, and compressive sensing, to name just a few.  Until recently, most algorithms for solving inferential and estimation problems have iteratively applied static models derived from physics or intuition. In this course, we will explore a new approach that is based on “learning” various elements of the problem including i) stepsizes and parameters of iterative algorithms, ii) regularizers, and iii) inverse functions.  For example, we will explore a new approach for solving inverse problems that is based on transforming an iterative, physics-based algorithm into a deep network whose parameters can be learned from training data.  For a range of different inverse problems, deep networks have been shown to offer faster convergence to a better quality solution.  Specific topics to be discussed include:  Ill-posed inverse problems, iterative optimization, deep learning, neural networks, learning regularizers. This is a “reading course,” meaning that students will read and present classic and recent papers from the technical literature to the rest of the class in a lively debate format.  Discussions will aim at identifying common themes and important trends in the field.  Students will also get hands on experience with optimization problems and deep learning software through a group project. Repeatable for Credit.",

    "description" : "\"Today, anyone with a laptop, tablet, or phone can potentially turn into a music producer. With affordable technology, a new generation of artists are changing the music industry from their bedroom. Not only are the tools of music more affordable, but there are also tons of resources to help an aspiring hobbyist build an adequate music studio at home.\nThis course is designed to teach students who are looking for their next hobby the fundamental technical skills they need to start creating their own music from home. We will discuss essential equipment, how to navigate a Digital Audio Workstation, different genres and styles of music production, and how to develop a growth mindset when creating music. These lessons will be addressed through the help of online video guides, readings, and in-class discussion and demonstrations. A very surface level introduction to music theory and mixing mastering will also be taught. \n\nThis course will answer two essential questions: (1) What influences the artistic choices a producer makes? & (2) How can an artist be productively critical of one’s own work in a way that balances perfectionism with progression? The course will culminate in a project where students release their own form of musical media. Students will also learn how music can improve their health and the value of creating music!\"",

We will study the history of representations of pain, the complex renderings of pain in art, the way pain is observed and measured in contemporary medicine, and the challenges of representing different “kinds” of pain. In doing so, we will develop a complex understanding of what Susan Sontag called our “more onerous citizenship” in the “kingdom of the sick” and collectively propose new ways of understanding pain.

For over 5,000 years, the Mahabharata, one of this world’s largest epics, played a significant role in shaping Indian and Hindu culture. This class is for anyone interested in dissecting stories, debating moral dilemmas, and learning more about other cultures. While the Mahabharata translates directly to the Great War, these stories are not merely battles and fighting. Within this epic lies the Bhagavad Gita, a defining text for Hindu and Indian philosophy. In this course, we will delve into the exciting tales of the Mahabharata, exploring the relatable characters, complex themes, and, of course, the perplexing moral dilemmas. Success in this course will be determined primarily by participation in discussions and willingness to learn about new and exciting stories. There will also be short weekly discussion posts to assess understanding and encourage reflection. Through such thought-provoking discussions and investigation of the epic’s many interpretations and adaptations, we will explore the essential question of how stories, both within and outside our culture, shape our values and philosophy.",

Building on this understanding, a succinct tour of geologic history will help us paint a more complete picture of Earth’s climate variations and how they affected human evolution and history. With this context, we will be able to judge the anomalous character of recent climate change, establish its anthropogenic nature, and discuss solutions to the current climate crisis.

Students will work closely with the course instructors to develop and design an original research project. The course includes a faculty-led visit to an international site so students may gain experience in conducting research first hand in an international setting. During this trip, students will meet with relevant decision leaders, community members, other stakeholders, and university faculty with expertise on their research topic. Upon their return to Rice, students will complete their research papers with regular guidance and feedback from the course instructors. The papers will be presented in class and students with exceptionally strong projects will be encouraged to summarize their major findings in the form of posters and present them at the Rice Undergraduate Research Symposium (RURS).

The course will address instrumental variables as well as exploratory use of causal methods for model building and design of studies. We will survey applications through case studies in various disciplines.  After taking this course students will be able to construct causal models, estimate causal effects and distinguish what data are relevant and irrelevant for causal analysis.  Students will also be introduced to software techniques using R.  Recommended Prerequisite(s): The course is open to all graduate students, but students should be aware that this is a graduate level course in statistics. Students should be performing graduate level research in their respective fields and\/or have a background in statistical inference and research methods."

Computational projects motivated by different science and engineering applications are used to introduce basic numerical methods, and develop computational solutions using Matlab and Python. No programming knowledge is required or expected; students learn how to implement their solutions in Matlab and Python. Lectures are held Mondays and Wednesdays.  In a laboratory component held on Fridays, students work in small groups on computational projects led by a Rice Learning Assistant. Fall\/Spring semester: meeting 3 times per week (50min each meeting). Summer semester: meeting 5 times per week (65min each meeting) OR refer to the current schedule.

    "description" : "This undergraduate course will introduce students to the fundamentals of natural and anthropogenic climate change. After briefly reviewing Earth’s composition and its fluid envelopes, we will cover the basic physics of the climate system, providing tools to understand weather and climate phenomena (e.g. monsoons, El Niño), the greenhouse effect, and climate feedbacks. Building on this understanding, a succinct tour of geologic history will help us paint a more complete picture of Earth’s climate variations and how they affected human evolution and history. With this context, we will be able to judge the anomalous character of recent climate change, establish its anthropogenic nature, and discuss solutions to the current climate crisis. Students from any major are encouraged to enroll and engage on important topic. Cross-list: ENST 201.",

However, through perseverance and strategic re-thinking of how viruses and cells could be used as therapeutics, the field is currently experiencing a biotechnological revolution. In December of 2017, a virus-based gene therapy drug was approved by the FDA, making it the first of its kind for the treatment of an inherited disease. This landmark achievement is just the beginning of a new era of human therapeutics. This class will discuss the gene therapy field – where it was and where it is now. Clinically important vectors currently under human testing, and opportunities for the next generation of improved gene delivery vectors will be presented. The biological and physiological barriers to efficient gene delivery will be investigated in order to spur new ideas for improving vector efficiency and specificity. Cross-list: BIOE 422.

Yet, this omnipresence of markets raises fundamental ethical questions. Is it really good that we organize exchange and production largely through markets? How are societies and individuals impacted by centrally relying on them? Should we, much rather, prefer a planned economy? Or would such a planned economy unduly constrain people's freedom? And, if we opt for markets, what are their moral limits? Should human organs or access to lawmakers be distributed via a market? Should access to health-care be governed by market principles? This seminar explores these questions through contemporary and historical readings, drawing on a broad set of ideas in order to tackle the philosophical, moral and existential challenges that markets pose.",

Its presence may appear more discreetly in the form of hearing a song in an ad, or more intentionally such as in the thorough analysis of an album. To best receive what music has to offer in this world of diversifying styles and genres, it may be valuable to understand how to create your own music. This course attempts to tackle the objective that is teaching music production by asking the question: What makes a good song? Through a series of units that catalog different styles of music spanning from alternative rock to contemporary rap, this class will explore what it means to understand music by deconstructing its very essence. Students will learn the basics of music theory, and the process of production within many differing styles in order to be able to create their own pieces of music.",

    "description" : "Climate variability and change pose threats to lives and livelihoods. These climate risks can be\nmanaged through the design and operation of infrastructure systems, as well as through disaster\nresponse and recovery. Decisions about how to develop and choose risk management strategies are often based on pure vibes, but occasionally rigorous quantitative analyses that make use of scientific information can inform them (we will focus on these cases). These analyses involve integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines to balance competing goals (objectives) under uncertainty. In this course, you will learn a structured bottom-up decision analytic framework for quantitative climate risk analysis. This involves (i) defining a system of interest and what constitutes desirable outcomes; (ii) understanding and modeling the specific pathways through which climate variability and change can create risk to this system; (iii) identifying possible levers for risk management; (iv) quantifying the performance of proposed decisions under climate and other interacting factors; and (v) generating possible alternatives. You will be assigned readings for every class that cover relevant methods or applications, and will work collaboratively to implement key concepts through programming problem sets. Active class participation is required. Methods covered include scenario analysis, exploratory modeling, cost-benefit analysis, single- and multi-objective policy search, stochastic control, deep uncertainty, robust decision making, and equitable decision making.

Such applications include for instance, weather prediction, air quality management, VLSI chip design, molecular dynamics, active noise reduction, chemical reactors, etc. In all these cases complexity manifests itself as the number of first order differential equations which arise. Model (order) reduction (MOR) seeks to replace a large-scale system described in terms of differential or difference equations by a system of much lower dimension that has nearly the same response characteristics. The ensuing methods have been an indispensable tool for speeding up the simulations arising in various engineering applications involving large-scale dynamical systems. In this course we will develop the underlying approximation theory paying particular attention to its data-driven aspects. Cross-list: ELEC 519.

While Business 540 focuses on seminal theory and recent theoretical approaches in the strategic management literature, this seminar focuses on phenomena and research topics in strategy research. It provides an overview of classic and current research topics including innovation and technology strategy, strategic alliances and networks, international strategy, product diversification, corporate governance, executive leadership, strategic decision processes, change and adaptation. Specific topics and phenomena will be examined from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. From the theoretical perspective, we will discuss how the various theories discussed in Business 540 are used to explain these phenomena. From the empirical perspective, we will discuss various research designs and methods used to in research on these topics. Overall, the intent of this seminar is to provide students a foundation for conducting and publishing original research in strategic management. Repeatable for Credit.",

Amid both utopian and dystopian visions for the potential of AI, important questions about the role of “artificial” intelligence in “human” society are newly emerging or being considered anew: what kinds of sociotechnical processes count as “AI”? What will be the moral status of “autonomous” entities? What will be the social, cultural, and political impact of AI? What will this impact be in different cultures and nations around the world? In this class, we will draw on a diverse set of historical and theoretical materials - including academic texts, historical analyses, technical reports, and science fiction film and literature - to examine the affordances and limitations of AI in areas such as labor, healthcare, and criminal justice, and on software such as videogames, social media platforms, and virtual reality.

The course will cover the design and analysis of agents that do the right thing in the face of limited information and computational resources. The course revolves around two main questions: how agents decide what to do, and how they learn from experience. Tools from computer science, probability theory, and game theory will be used. Interesting examples of intelligent agents will be covered, including poker playing programs, bots for various games (e.g. WoW), DS1 -- the spacecraft that performed an autonomous flyby of Comet Borrely in 2001, Stanley -- the Stanford robot car that won the Darpa Grand Challenge, Google Maps and how it calculates driving directions, face and handwriting recognizers, Fedex package delivery planners, airline fare prediction sites, and fraud detectors in financial transactions. Additional coursework required beyond the undergraduate course requirements. Cross-list: COMP 440, ELEC 440, COMP 557.

Several spatial-temporal discretization methods will be taught, primarily the finite difference method, but also moderate exposure to the finite volume method, and light exposure to the finite element method. Explicit and implicit approaches, in addition to methods to solve linear equations are employed to study fluid flows. A review of various finite difference methods which will be used to analyze elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic partial differential equations and the concepts of stability, consistency and convergence are taught to familiarize the students with general numerical PDE methods. Commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software used in the field will be briefly introduced.\n Repeatable for Credit.",

We will track the histories and afterlives of slavery and colonialism that continue to transfigure our society, while also studying varied blueprints for, and critiques of, alternative, more egalitarian societies imagined by these artists.",

In particular, those robots which can physically interact with the world possess essential skills, called manipulation, to engage themselves more comprehensively in the real-world tasks. For example, robots with manipulation skills can help us in factories, kitchens, hospitals, warehouses, constructions sites, and even in space or on another planet. This course will introduce both fundamental and the state-of-the-art knowledge that enable robots to manipulate in our world. Topics including robot motions, kinematics, dynamics, simulation and ROS, hand and grasping, prehensile and nonprehensile manipulation, robot control, and interactive estimation, will be covered. Significant programming projects are involved to facilitate converting the textbook knowledge to solid hands-on experiences. Cross-list: COMP 462.

    "description" : "Machine learning is the process of automatically inferring a function from a set of data. In essence, machine learning techniques seek to automate the inductive learning process that humans do so well. Furthermore, the availability of large training sets combined with significant computing power has made machine learning an extremely important body of knowledge across a large range of application domains. A small sample of some of the application domains include robotics, medicine, speech\/facial recognition, and driving autonomous vehicles. This course will focus on providing a foundational understanding of modern algorithms in machine learning, focusing on practical applications. Enrollment in online sections limited to students in the OMCS or OMDS programs. Enrollment in in person sections limited to students in the MCS or MDS programs. In order to enroll in an online section of this course, you are expected to have a working camera and microphone.  During class sessions, you must be able to participate using your microphone and you are expected to have your camera on for the duration of the class so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class, just as you would be in an in-person class.

Our conversations will integrate everything from the technicalities of music theory to trends in visual art to historical and political context, all of which can constitute a sense of purpose and\/or meaning for works of new music. The course will be designed for students of all prior musical backgrounds (even those with no prior experience); I have carefully designed the class to be centered around accessible, relatable dialogues complemented by guided, example-based critical listening."

This course begins with a study of the art and architecture of the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Lombards, Celts, Anglo-Saxons, Franks, and Merovingians, and the transformation of the Roman World through new Germanic, Barbarian, and Christian forces.  The second part of the course considers the cultural Renaissance of the Carolingian and Ottonian Periods under rulers such as Charlemagne and Otto III.  The last third of the course focuses on themes of pilgrimage, relics, crusades and the emergence of new monumental tradition in art and architecture during the Romanesque Period.

After completing this course students will understand how and why anthropologists study the living, the dead and the undead.

    "description" : "\"Crochet isn’t just your grandma’s favorite pastime—from the Crochet Coral Reef’s response to climate change to a published model of chaos, this yarn-based handicraft has been used to illustrate, educate, and reimagine concepts from various STEM fields. While this strange combination remains relatively unexplored, many of these works have gained recognition for their approachability, presenting elaborate scientific and mathematical topics in easy-to-understand ways. Here, we seek to examine the question: what can crochet teach us about STEM, and how can we use this niche to reimagine our understanding of STEM?\n\nIn this course, we will explore these intersections, taking a closer look at the form, function, and context behind STEM-based crochet projects. Students will learn basic crochet techniques, read short texts about specific artworks and applications, apply this knowledge toward guided crochet projects, and design their own STEM-inspired crochet concept. All students of any skill level are welcome; prior knowledge in crochet, science, or math is not required nor assumed.\"",

But moral lessons are all around us and are intrinsic in every story we tell. Heroes and villains wrestle with concepts of good and evil and so do we. Philosophy can seem like an intimidating subject matter, but we use it everyday. We make choices and judge them based on morality. In deciding the right course of action, we make philosophical arguments without even realizing it. \n\nThis course is a very basic overview of how philosophers argue and what sort of moral arguments they make. But more than that this course is about the arguments we make, learn and analyze when we tell and listen to stories. In this course, students will read stories and watch TV shows then analyze what moral lesson is being taught and whether that lesson is a good one to teach. A cross between literature\/film studies and philosophy, this course is designed to be relaxed, engaging and approachable for everyone. \"",

Through language we are able to expand on ideas, build the frameworks for support, and create a deeper level of connection between members in a conversation. \nThe purpose of this course is to provide insight into how the utilization of language – and the ways in which we present ourselves through it – can improve one’s ability to not only listen but also converse. How can being intentional with how we use language affect the quality of a conversation or even the relationships we have? In this course, we will go over the many facets of language – verbal, physical\/body, cultural differences, silence, and other special topics – and discuss strategies that can help us become better listeners and communicators, regardless of the type of conversation. I will assign appropriate readings and videos prior to class where we can open up a discussion and share relevant experiences. To make the material of the class useful, we will also do role-plays where students will be presented a scenario, assigned a role in a conversation, and then expected to use the strategies that have been discussed to guide such conversation.\"",

Through a series of tutorial lectures, students will acquire familiarity with cutting-edge research topics in various subfields of applied physics, including quantum information engineering, low-dimensional materials, ultracold atoms, nanophotonics, plasmonics and metamaterials, and neuroengineering. Furthermore, students will gain hands-on research experience in trial projects provided by different laboratories in APP through mini-rotations (3 weeks per laboratory). The primary goal of this course is to assist first-year APP students to find Ph.D. advisors by the end of the fall semester so they can start Ph.D. research in the spring semester. Additionally, this course aims to provide first-year APP students with an opportunity to develop a genuine camaraderie within the cohort by spending time together. Furthermore, each first-year student will be mentored by a senior APP student throughout the semester to get fully integrated into the program and the Rice community.

By contrast, the voices of women philosophers (such as Karoline von Günderrode, Bettina von Arnim or Clara Zetkin) are rarely remembered, and even less frequently taught. This course aims to change that. Reading a wide array of texts written by women intellectuals of the time, we will aim to understand their philosophical contributions to German Idealism (e.g. Günderrode and Arnim), Feminism (e.g. Zetkin and Hedwig Dohm) and classical Socialism (e.g. Rosa Luxemburg). We will also examine their relationship to, and, more importantly, their critique of the work of some of their male counterparts (such as Fichte, Schelling, Marx and Nietzsche). Finally, we will consider why these women's voices have been so frequently neglected – and why it is, from a contemporary philosophical standpoint, worthwhile to discover them again.",

So, we tried to understand this information with questions and other cognitive tools at our disposal. Gradually, we got older and for many of us, our ability to understand increasingly complex concepts has not caught up with our desire to do so. Though, through this course, this potential to understand is no longer a mystery. What we need is a restructuring of how we understand concepts.\n\nIn this course, we will delve into the theory and application of understanding concepts through mainly cognitive science and philosophy. We will achieve this through reading the latest research on integrating conceptual information, mindmapping with proper chunking and interconnected techniques, utilizing self-guided questions in response to complex concepts, and working in teams to solve novel problems. For example, students will draw mindmaps for subjects like music theory or philosophy with the aim of high mastery of retention. Students will complete in-class progress cehcks, homework assignments, and a final project. Although this class has no prerequisites, there are high expectations for each student to come into each lecture ready to learn and participate in discussions.\"",

Although the primary focus of the class will be on artists, writers, philosophers, and critics based in the metropole, the larger scope of the British Empire and the impact of British imperialism and colonialism on aesthetic production and debates will be an active concern for this class. Beginning in the early eighteenth century, this course will pay particular attention to the ways in which artists, philosophers, and critics responded to a wide array of social debates that were transforming British cultural production including: copyright and the controversy of artistic property; various monetary and financial crises ; changes in the law; and the decline in a model of civic humanism premised on land holding and property.\nGraduate students are required to give two 30-40 minute presentations and a final 20-25 page paper, and they will have roughly 3-4 hours of reading per week.

    "description" : "In many applications one is faced with the task of simulating or controlling complex dynamical systems. Such applications include for instance, weather prediction, air quality management, VLSI chip design, molecular dynamics, active noise reduction, chemical reactors, etc. In all these cases complexity manifests itself as the number of first order differential equations which arise. Model (order) reduction (MOR) seeks to replace a large-scale system described in terms of differential or difference equations by a system of much lower dimension that has nearly the same response characteristics. The ensuing methods have been an indispensable tool for speeding up the simulations arising in various engineering applications involving large-scale dynamical systems. In this course we will develop the underlying approximation theory paying particular attention to its data-driven aspects.

Furthermore, probability and statistics are essential for data science, as they are the foundation for quantifying uncertainty and assessing support for hypotheses and derived models. This course covers topics in probability and statistics, including probability and random variables, basic stochastic processes, basic descriptive statistics, and various methods for statistical inference and measuring support. In order to enroll in an online section of this course, you are expected to have a working camera and microphone. During class sessions, you must be able to participate using your microphone and you are expected to have your camera on for the duration of the class so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class, just as you would be in an in-person class.",

To get out of bed, lift objects, or clean our room, we need healthy range of motion around our joints. Over time, our inefficient habits of movement, and the decreased suppleness of muscle tissue that occurs naturally as we age can lead to reduced mobility of joints and compromised body positions. Staying active and stretching regularly reduces the chance of experiencing occasional and chronic musculoskeletal pain and helps prevent this loss of mobility. No previous experience is required and all fitness levels are welcome.",

The rise of China, the resurgence of Russia, and continuing turmoil in the Middle East confront U.S. policy makers with an array of complex challenges. This course focuses on these and other issues that are shaping U.S. foreign policy today.

By considering the role Black anthropologists have played as ethnographic knowledge producers, rather than simply ethnographic objects, this seminar considers not how race has shaped the study of culture. In addressing the discipline's legacy of anti-Blackness in the study of \"cultural difference,\" this class considers how Black anthropologists have drawn on concepts and theories within Black Studies to reimagine and rewrite their own genealogy within the discipline. From Du Boisian political economy of racism and Black feminist poetics and performance to contemporary discussions of decolonizing and abolitionist anthropology, this course addresses how Black anthropologists have created ethnographic approaches that not only redress disciplinary anti-Black racism, but also, most importantly, provide approaches studying the robustness of Black life.

    "description" : "Data Science has taken the world by storm. Examples of great success can be seen everywhere. This has opened the way for myriad industries and sectors to try to develop their own best practices. Especially since the COVID pandemic, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other computational technologies have grown rapidly during the past couple of years. However, not everyone knows which, how, when, or why to implement these techniques. Many engineers, for example, oversee or work with daily streams of data and want to use them in the most efficient way possible. The main objective of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to statistical and computational methods for modern data problems faced by engineers and engineering managers. By using statistical frameworks and data science as main drivers, the student will survey and compare algorithms for various data applications, learning how to select the most suitable according to real life scenarios.\n\nIn order to enroll in an online section of this course, you are expected to have a working camera and microphone.  During class sessions, you must be able to participate using your microphone and you are expected to have your camera on for the duration of the class so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class, just as you would be in an in person class.",

Using a mix of lectures, thought provoking discussion of contemporary research, and hand on lab exercises, the student will gain an intuitive understanding of what factors determine the population dynamics of pathogens and their hosts and how we can predict and control them. We will start by learning how we can quantify and model disease transmission, and then dive into the many factors that influence how diseases spread within and across species to cause epidemics, and explore what factors drive evolution of disease virulence and host defenses. We will end by exploring different control efforts to limit the spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and discuss how these efforts depend on the intricate connections between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment (One Health).",

This is an introductory course for speaking Amharic with no previous exposure required. Even students with some exposure will improve greatly as they will recite the alphabets, count in Amharic, and use the most common words in basic social dialogues. Students will refer to the Amharic alphabet, amharicteacher.com resources and my teaching as a native speaker. By summarizing the cultural background each morphological and syntactical rule is rooted in, this class goes beyond a language to also learn about Ethiopia and its culture, hence the second part of the title – Speaking Abyssinian - Abyssinia being the first name given to Ethiopia. By the end of the term, this course ensures that students explain how languages serve as a means of understanding others and one’s own culture.",

    "description" : "\"The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a flash mob as a group of people summoned to a designated location at a specified time to perform an indicated action before dispersing. With the first flash mob occurring in 2003, flash mobs remained a popular trend until the early 2010s. In this class, we will explore in detail the cultural phenomenon of flash mobs with the goal of answering the question how can you conduct a well-organized flash mob in order for it to be a fun and engaging activity for all involved?\nWe will begin by delving into the history of flash mobs by examining the influence of social media on flash mobs, the common threads between successful flash mobs, and the regulations surrounding them. Then, we will explore different types of popular dance and choreography with the help of different student dance groups on campus, eventually moving into choreographing dances of our own. Finally, we will rehearse and perform this flash mob as a class in a public setting as the ultimate culmination of our work. Students can expect to start this course from a completely beginner standpoint (no experience is required!) and end the course as a confident flash mob participant. \"",

We will explore the modern rules and customs of the sport and seek to understand how, and why, those have changed over time. In doing so, we will watch matches, have debates, and investigate different ranking systems. Additionally, we will watch and discuss the cultural significance of media like Haikyuu and Ashita e Attack. \n\nOn the other hand, we want to know how volleyball is actually played. What is “proper form” and when does it fail? How do the motions differ between beach and indoor, men’s and women’s, collegiate and international? We also want to understand the physics and physiology that is volleyball. Though we can’t draw a free body diagram on every play, we will practice different skills and perform motor profile tests to understand our own movement preferences. By the end of this course, we will look to have a comprehensive understanding of what exercises, skills, strategies, mindsets, and extraneous factors contribute to success playing. \"",

    "description" : "Human brain activity is a specific form bioelectromagnetism, which is the multi-disciplinary study of the electromagnetic (EM) phenomena that arise in biological tissues. This class studies the considerable variety of “brain signals” and the generation of their corresponding EM fields that can be detected with electric and magnetic sensors. What is the intrinsic information of each signal type and in what context are those useful? Topics include EM, biophysics, spectral analysis, forward modeling, reciprocity, source localization, and the electrode\/insulator design. Your final team project will build a finite element model (FEM) of brain activity and\/or biophysical model and analyze those signals in a specific application. Cross-list: ELEC 583.  Recommended Prerequisite(s): Introductory courses in physics, e.g. Physics 102 or 112 or 126, and time-series signal analysis, e.g., ELEC 242 or NEUR 383. Mutually Exclusive: Cannot register for ELEC 481 if student has credit for ELEC 583.",

We have commonly depicted the Victorians as persons who revered the institutions of religion, family, country and social convention.

Oftentimes, the input data can be naturally represented as a graph, such as for relational learning tasks applied to social\nnetworks and graph kernels applied to chemical data. Other times, graphs are just a framework to express some intrinsic structure in the data, such as for graphical models and non-linear\nembedding. In both cases, recent advances in representation learning (or graph embedding)\nand deep learning have generated a renewed interest in machine learning on graphs. At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to: (1) identify the appropriate graph-based machine learning algorithm for a given problem; (2) extend existing algorithms to solve new related problems; and (3) recognize some of the key research challenges in the field. The\ncourse will be a mixture of lectures, a research paper presentation, homework assignments\n(including programming), and a hands-on class project. Cross-list: COMP 459.
