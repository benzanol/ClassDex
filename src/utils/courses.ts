        "description": "This class examines the history of Black art in America since the early 1900s. What is Black Art? Who are the artists, curators, scholars, and theorists who have asked and answered this question over the decades? Is a Black aesthetic inherently revolutionary and interested in the political lives of black people and their liberation? Or is a Black aesthetic best exemplified by the manipulation of materials, visual composition, and saturation? Or both? We will engage theories of black art and aesthetics that emerged in the 1920s through today to take seriously the question: how does the visual life of blackness matter? In this class we will break through the traditional rhetoric of diversity and representation and discuss how artists over the decades have insisted instead on redistributions of power, radical and speculative material practices, and structural change. It is my priority to make this course on black aesthetics joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities. Cross-list: HART 204.",

This course will consider three questions: how do individual voters interact with the voting technology, how are voting technologies engineered to be accurate and secure, and how do the social aspects of voting fulfill democratic goals for elections?

Throughout this course, we will complicate the narrative that sees Jews and Arabs as perpetual enemies through a historical and philosophical exploration into the development of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. Students will think historically about the construction of race, ethnicity, and religion and the various modes by which these are employed, and they will use that knowledge to think critically about current depictions of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic violence. In the first part of the course, we will consider some of the historical and conceptual underpinnings of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. We will begin in medieval Spain and then track their development through modernity, paying close attention to how these discourses changed and evolved over time; in the second part, we will look at the impact of the Holocaust and the rise of the State of Israel and consider current iterations of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in Europe and America today.

In this course, we will learn about how anthropologists, sociologists, and historians have looked at pandemics in different places and times, as a backdrop for a focus on the Covid-19 pandemic.",

However, by drawing on different narrative forms \u2014 from memoir, fiction writing, film, and poetry, in addition to ethnography \u2014 the course will enable students to experiment with narrative forms to reass whether and how the body becomes the source of sickness. By considering the relationship between narrative form and the metaphors of illness it enables, students will develop their own illness narrative projects to reimagine and re-write our understanding of health inequalities today.",

We examine how human-animal relationships have changed over time, and consider human impacts upon animals and environments at multiple scales: from continental and island colonizations, to local extirpations and global extinctions. While our scope is both geographically and temporally broad, specific case studies will be highlighted from Africa, Eurasia, North America, and the Pacific islands. The unifying thread among these case studies is a focus on lines of evidence, with the goal of exposing students to the diverse methods of archaeology: how can archaeologists determine the impacts of humans upon animals and vice versa, and how well are their interpretations supported by their data? Finally, we consider how knowledge of the past can help shape our approaches to animals and their environments today, with respect for the planet that we all share. Cross-list: ANTH 552.

Design anthropology is a fast-developing interdisciplinary field that incorporates concepts, research methods and creative practices drawn from design and anthropology. Design anthropology draws upon anthropological insights into social relations and cultural forms in order to challenge expert-defined design practices with more collaborative and contextually sensitive processes of design co-creation. In the first half of this seminar, we will explore the history of social design and how anthropological culture theory and its insights into the interpretation of meaning (e.g., Geertz) have directly impacted practices of social design. We will also explore how design\u2019s concern with innovation and futurity has attracted interest from public anthropologists interested not only in analyzing the world as it stands but also changing it for the better. In the second half of the course, the seminar will incorporate studio exercises where students will work in teams to practice social design skills through public-engaged projects to identify problems that are susceptible to social design solutions. Cross-list: ANTH 568. Recommended Prerequisite(s): There are no specific prerequisites for this course. However, introductory level familiarity with anthropological theory and practice will be helpful. Design skills will also be useful, although are not required since the seminar\u2019s focus will be on design ideation.

While our scope is both geographically and temporally broad, specific case studies will be highlighted from Africa, Eurasia, North America, and the Pacific islands. The unifying thread among these case studies is a focus on lines of evidence, with the goal of exposing students to the diverse methods of archaeology: how can archaeologists determine the impacts of humans upon animals and vice versa, and how well are their interpretations supported by their data? Finally, we consider how knowledge of the past can help shape our approaches to animals and their environments today, with respect for the planet that we all share. Cross-list: ANTH 352.

Design anthropology is a fast-developing interdisciplinary field that incorporates concepts, research methods and creative practices drawn from design and anthropology. Design anthropology draws upon anthropological insights into social relations and cultural forms in order to challenge expert-defined design practices with more collaborative and contextually sensitive processes of design co-creation. In the first half of this seminar, we will explore the history of social design and how anthropological culture theory and its insights into the interpretation of meaning (e.g., Geertz) have directly impacted practices of social design. We will also explore how design\u2019s concern with innovation and futurity has attracted interest from public anthropologists interested not only in analyzing the world as it stands but also changing it for the better. In the second half of the course, the seminar will incorporate studio exercises where students will work in teams to practice social design skills through public-engaged projects to identify problems that are susceptible to social design solutions. Cross-list: ANTH 368. Recommended Prerequisite(s): There are no specific prerequisites for this course. However, introductory level familiarity with anthropological theory and practice will be helpful. Design skills will also be useful, although are not required since the seminar\u2019s focus will be on design ideation.

STS is a field that focuses on how power is infused in how we create scientific knowledge, how we disseminate \u201cobjective\u201d information, and how it materializes in the technology we build into our everyday lives. However, how might we better understand \u201cscience\u201d through an intersectional framework that attends to race, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously? Drawing on critical methods of speculation, the course will address the following themes: the role of racism in social reproduction through the body from colonialism and slavery to contemporary genomics; humanism; the racialization of physical matter and space; and concluding with Afrofuturism. In addition to mobilizing the theories and concepts developed to bear witness to the particularity of Black womxns lived experience, this class has us consider what Black feminism can teach us about how to reckon with building a more with just and equitable world with science and technology against various oppressive forces.

Within our universal understanding of art, place can be identified in a variety of ways: painting, drawing, photography, etc. Each formal output is the materialization of space. In this course, we will work through the ways in which we can materialize a three-dimensional one.

The development of specialized vocabulary to describe, analyze, and communicate function, composition, and meaning in art. 2) Understand major artistic movements of art and architecture within historical, social, political contexts. 3) Develop specialized knowledge in art from specific geographical locations (e.g. China), time periods, artists or artistic movements. 4) Evaluate and use primary and secondary source materials.

In December of 2017, a virus-based gene therapy drug was approved by the FDA, making it the first of its kind for the treatment of an inherited disease. This landmark achievement is just the beginning of a new era of human therapeutics. This class will discuss the gene therapy field \u2013 where it was and where it is now. Clinically important vectors currently under human testing, and opportunities for the next generation of improved gene delivery vectors will be presented. The biological and physiological barriers to efficient gene delivery will be investigated in order to spur new ideas for improving vector efficiency and specificity. Cross-list: BIOE 422.

Small groups will meet weekly with a graduate student or postdoctoral researcher to explore a published research article by a local lab, gaining background information about the subject and exposure to the research techniques. In the final session, the group will tour the lab that produced the featured article. Additional tours and activities TBA. All first-year non-transfer students are eligible to enroll in BIOS 118 regardless of AP credit. This course meets in the second half of the semester and features research in biochemistry, cell biology, and genetics, and related fields.",

The course begins with a brief history of how infectious diseases have shaped human history and progresses to present day challenges including emerging pathogens both natural and man-made. We will do deep dives of several important pandemic diseases to understand their epidemiological contexts, pathogenesis and disease states. We will then examine how vaccines, antiviral and antimicrobial strategies work to protect human health at the molecular level. Importantly, we will then examine how molecular evolution provides adaptation to various biomedical interventions and why the fight against infectious diseases cannot be easily won.

The course begins with a brief history of how infectious diseases have shaped human history and progresses to present day challenges including emerging pathogens both natural and man-made. We will do deep dives of several important pandemic diseases to understand their epidemiological contexts, pathogenesis and disease states. We will then examine how vaccines, antiviral and antimicrobial strategies work to protect human health at the molecular level. Importantly, we will then examine how molecular evolution provides adaptation to various biomedical interventions and why the fight against infectious diseases cannot be easily won.

In this course we will delve into the diverse landscape of reality TV shows from various places and time periods, from Keeping Up With the Kardashians to Indian Matchmaking. How does reality TV reflect the world around it and the culture that it comes from- and what kind of intellectual and artistic value does it have? Students will discuss these questions after class readings and in-class screenings, researching and learning about different perspectives, and for their final project, will propose an idea for their own reality TV show. The class will aim to cover an episode of a different reality show every 1-2 weeks.",

Here, the topics covered are integral polyhedra and perfect formulations, including TU matrices and TDI systems. We culminate with exact methodologies for integer programming, including branch-and-bound and cutting-plane techniques. This course provides the foundations for further studies in convex optimization, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic programming. Cross-list: CMOR 541.

While this layered architecture has made building systems easier, it has also made understanding their behavior and performance more difficult. Every layer from the managed run-time environments used by modern programming languages to the hypervisor play a role in processor scheduling, memory management, and I/O, making it oftentimes difficult to pinpoint which layer of the system is interacting poorly with a program. This class will teach students about the fundamental characteristics of the abstractions for processing, memory, and I/O at each layer of a modern computer system, so that they might understand the functionality provided by each layer, and instruct them on the use of modern debugging, profiling, and tracing tools, so that they are equipped to characterize the behavior and performance of their programs.

Designed for anyone interested in Francophone society or creative writing for social justice, this English-taught course explores language\u2019s social change potential through 'le rap conscient', a socially and linguistically significant Francophone music genre that holds up a mirror to society to encourage social change. With selected works from artists of diverse backgrounds, we will discuss the artist and the work\u2019s social/historical context, symbolism and meaning, and ways artists play with words and language structures. We will also discuss the genre\u2019s broader linguistic significance and contributions to social progress. There are no exams and no *home*work other than occasional small reflections and the final project, where students create their own multilingual rap conscient with the optional help of ChatGPT. All other class-related work is reflective and designed to be completed in class, though students are always welcome to explore course-related questions more deeply between classes and share findings. Linking language learning with the communicative intent of 'le rap conscient', we consider our essential question: How can understanding 'le rap conscient' and its various roles help us envision a just world?",

Using a mix of lectures, thought provoking discussion of contemporary research, and hand on lab exercises, the student will gain an intuitive understanding of what factors determine the population dynamics of pathogens and their hosts and how we can predict and control them. We will start by learning how we can quantify and model disease transmission, and then dive into the many factors that influence how diseases spread within and across species to cause epidemics, and explore what factors drive evolution of disease virulence and host defenses. We will end by exploring different control efforts to limit the spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and discuss how these efforts depend on the intricate connections between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment (One Health).",

        "description": "Robots have fascinated people for generations. Today, robots are built for applications as diverse as exploring remote planets, de-mining war zones, cleaning toxic waste, assembling cars, inspecting pipes in industrial plants and mowing lawns. Robots are also interacting with humans in a variety of ways: robots are museum guides, robots assist surgeon sin life threatening operations, and robotic cars can drive us around. The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today\u2019s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions. It will also explore fundamentals of the field of Artificial Intelligence through the prism of robotics. The class involves a significant programming project.

Designed for students who have no background in Chinese art, Chinese history, or art history, the seminar uses diverse teaching materials in multiple media beyond traditional textbook-based readings to achieve four main goals: 1) Develop visual literacy through a direct encounter with objects. The development of specialized vocabulary to describe, analyze, and communicate function, composition, and meaning in art. 2) Understand major artistic movements of art and architecture within historical, social, political contexts. 3) Develop specialized knowledge in art from specific geographical locations (e.g. China), time periods, artists or artistic movements. 4) Evaluate and use primary and secondary source materials.

What does it mean to queer the visual realm? What does it mean to center an expanded sensorial queerness? In this class, we will look at how artists engage the sensory modalities of sound, touch, proprioception, and interoception as both method and material within their work. We will consider the use of spit, bodily fluids, blood, sweat, vibrations, visceral inclinations, indigestion, balance, and other sensory things to ask: How do senses evoke dissident feelings? As Kyle Wazanna Tompkins writes in the 2015 winter issue of A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, \u201cTo aim for the visceral, we have found, is to come at feeling, at sex, at sensation, at theory itself, from a queer place.\u201d It is my priority to make this course on contemporary art joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities.

Today, robots are built for applications as diverse as exploring remote planets, de-mining war zones, cleaning toxic waste, assembling cars, inspecting pipes in industrial plants and mowing lawns. Robots are also interacting with humans in a variety of ways: robots are museum guides, robots assist surgeon sin life threatening operations, and robotic cars can drive us around. The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today\u2019s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions. It will also explore fundamentals of the field of Artificial Intelligence through the prism of robotics. The class involves a significant programming project.

It covers the main events that shaped the region from the final years of the Ottoman empire, to the creation of the nation-states by Western colonialism, to the struggles for independence and decolonization. The course tackles some of the following themes: reform and modernization in the Ottoman Empire; World War One and its impact on the Middle East; the emergence of a new world order, and modern states and their political systems since World War I; and the transformation of Middle Eastern societies during this same period under the impact of colonialism, independence, regional wars, and oil. It also sheds light on particular social and cultural phenomena: the role of women in society; changing notions of gender roles; class formation and relations; and cultural expressions through art, literature and new modes and spaces of sociability.",

        "description": "As a basic component of fitness, flexibility is needed to perform everyday activities with a relative amount of ease. To get out of bed, lift objects, or clean our room, we need healthy range of motion around our joints. Over time, our inefficient habits of movement, and the decreased suppleness of muscle tissue that occurs naturally as we age can lead to reduced mobility of joints and compromised body positions. Staying active and stretching regularly reduces the chance of experiencing occasional and chronic musculoskeletal pain and helps prevent this loss of mobility. No previous experience is required and all fitness levels are welcome.",

Today, robots are built for applications as diverse as exploring remote planets, de-mining war zones, cleaning toxic waste, assembling cars, inspecting pipes in industrial plants and mowing lawns. Robots are also interacting with humans in a variety of ways: robots are museum guides, robots assist surgeon sin life threatening operations, and robotic cars can drive us around. The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today\u2019s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions. It will also explore fundamentals of the field of Artificial Intelligence through the prism of robotics. The class involves a significant programming project.

What are the consequences of this provenance? How have seemingly objective medical conceptions of the body preserved or retained this militaristic belief in independence, power, and control? And what are its consequences for those whose bodies are exposed to that domination? How does the history of immunity inspire contemporary depictions of BIOPOC, trans, queer, and undocumented lives as pathogenic to the flourishing of \u201chealthy\u201d bodies and in turn to their state-sponsored exposure to death? We will propose to answer these questions by integrating an interdisciplinary archive of fiction, film, philosophy, and law. Recommended Prerequisite(s): MDHM 201 Repeatable for Credit.",

In brief, the subjects covered by this course are: \u2022 Tribology. Topics will include empirical and heuristic friction models, the fundamentals of wear, lubrication selection and considerations, and fundamental failure modes. \u2022 Contact Mechanics. Topics will include elastic deformation, constitutive modeling, plasticity, failure criteria, and numerical simulation. \u2022 Nonlinear Dynamics. Topics will include an overview of linear vibration theory, model reduction theories, nonlinear vibration theory, nonlinear analysis including quasi-static analysis and harmonic balance methods, continuation, and modal analysis.

Is a Black aesthetic inherently revolutionary and interested in the political lives of black people and their liberation? Or is a Black aesthetic best exemplified by the manipulation of materials, visual composition, and saturation? Or both? We will engage theories of black art and aesthetics that emerged in the 1920s through today to take seriously the question: how does the visual life of blackness matter? In this class we will break through the traditional rhetoric of diversity and representation and discuss how artists over the decades have insisted instead on redistributions of power, radical and speculative material practices, and structural change. It is my priority to make this course on black aesthetics joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities. Cross-list: AAAS 204.",

In this course, we will learn both the analytical techniques and also complementary numerical methods. For the latter part, programming literacy is essential. This requires gaining proficiency in (1) the programming language, an aspect that involves learning the grammar and the syntax of the language, and (2) computational thinking, an aspect that is independent of the programming language and is a skill that is broadly applicable to all problem solving and analysis. We will study all these aspects with applications in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. If registering for CHBE 302, you must register for CHBE 301.",

        "description": "Role-playing video games, frequently shortened to role-playing games (RPGs), are a genre of video games, where the player interacts directly with the world, usually gaining character development in terms of recording statistics. The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story? In this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice.",

Computational Geophysics 2. Reservoir Simulation Fundamentals 3. Machine Learning The first two components will be taught together in the first 10 weeks by dedicating half of the class-time to each subject. The Machine Learning component will, in part, build on the first two fundamental components and will be taught using the full class time. Computational Geophysics The participants in this geophysics part of the course are expected to be interested into learn how to use modern seismic data to image the subsurface with awareness of the computational costs of the techniques involved. The main focus will be given to current seismic imaging tools including cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) applications. As the result of the successful completion of this course part, the course participants should be able to: (1) Understand the context and value of imaging tools for the hydrocarbon exploration business. (2) Relate the imaging tools with their computational costs for modern computer resources. (3) Properly use wave-based geophysical imaging and ML-based tools and (4) Understand main seismic processing and interpretation decisions. Applied Reservoir Simulation This component of the course will introduce participants to the practice of reservoir simulation. This class will be an applied course on reservoir simulation. Theoretical descriptions will be provided as warranted but will be kept to minimum. Class participants will learn about the fundamentals of applied reservoir simulation, use of a reservoir simulator, and how to select the proper model for a simulation study. This course will also cover data preparation, grid design, calibration of the reservoir model, forecasting of future performance, and interpretation of simulation results. Participants will also be introduced to the role of simulation in reservoir management, limitations of reservoir simulation, and the structural aspects of the models. Upscaling and recent advances simulation techniques will also be discussed. A realistic open-source reservoir simulation software will be used during the tutorials and computer projects. Machine Learning for Oil & Gas This part of the course will introduce the fundamentals of statistical learning, present a few of the popular learning paradigms and algorithms, and culminate in a small student project applying them to an oil reservoir data set using the R programming language (solutions to class problems will be accepted in any programming language or system). Much of the material presented here is also known under the names \u201cBig Data\u201d, \u201cData Analytics\u201d, \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d, \u201cData Mining\u201d, \u201cPetroleum Data Driven Analytics\u201d and other terms. Weeks 11 and 12 are theory only, weeks 13-15 will have small hands-on exercises incorporated and week 16 and 17 are dedicated to solving a simple oil reservoir problem using machine learning.",

STS is a field that focuses on how power is infused in how we create scientific knowledge, how we disseminate \u201cobjective\u201d information, and how it materializes in the technology we build into our everyday lives. However, how might we better understand \u201cscience\u201d through an intersectional framework that attends to race, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously? Drawing on critical methods of speculation, the course will address the following themes: the role of racism in social reproduction through the body from colonialism and slavery to contemporary genomics; humanism; the racialization of physical matter and space; and concluding with Afrofuturism. In addition to mobilizing the theories and concepts developed to bear witness to the particularity of Black womxns lived experience, this class has us consider what Black feminism can teach us about how to reckon with building a more with just and equitable world with science and technology against various oppressive forces.

In this course, rather than focusing on technical details, we will focus on highlighting for a broad, basic linear-algebra-savvy audience, the simplicity and generality of some core linear algebraic ideas. In particular, we will focus on two fundamental and much used matrix problems which have been at the center of recent developments: (1) Least Squares approximation and (2) Low-Rank Matrix Approximation. A key tool for achieving this goal are randomized algorithms which originated in TCS. Cross-list: ELEC 506.",

        "description": "This is a required course for first-year students in the Applied Physics Graduate Program (APP), introducing them to the multidisciplinary research field of applied physics and facilitating their laboratory affiliation process. Through a series of tutorial lectures, students will acquire familiarity with cutting-edge research topics in various subfields of applied physics, including quantum information engineering, low-dimensional materials, ultracold atoms, nanophotonics, plasmonics and metamaterials, and neuroengineering. Furthermore, students will gain hands-on research experience in trial projects provided by different laboratories in APP through mini-rotations (3 weeks per laboratory). The primary goal of this course is to assist first-year APP students to find Ph.D. advisors by the end of the fall semester so they can start Ph.D. research in the spring semester. Additionally, this course aims to provide first-year APP students with an opportunity to develop a genuine camaraderie within the cohort by spending time together. Furthermore, each first-year student will be mentored by a senior APP student throughout the semester to get fully integrated into the program and the Rice community. Recommended Prerequisite(s): Understanding of undergraduate-level classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, and solid-state physics",

        "description": "From the 1960s to 2000, Germany developed a very distinct auteur cinema with independent filmmakers such as Fassbinder, Herzog, Wenders, Kluge, Adlon, von Trotta, Sander, Brueckner, Garnier, Tykwer, and others. The first twenty years were oriented toward coming to terms with the fascist past; the second twenty years focused on more contemporary issues, including terrorism, misogyny, and xenophobia. To explore these issues, we will discuss the work of four major directors of the New German Cinema, whose films are concerned with pressing political questions as well as their own nature as \u201cfilms.\u201d To further our discussions of the politics and aesthetics of visual media in general and of film in particular, the screenings will be put into dialogue with short, often canonical, theoretical texts. Mutually exclusive with and formerly offered as GERM 338. Students cannot earn credit for GERM 332 if they have received credit for GERM 338.",

Students will become familiar with queer, trans, and feminist theory and will see that key issues and debates appear in both scholarship and political activism globally and in the United States. The course addresses intersectional frameworks for understanding race, class, and other social relations; normative sexualities and genders; and non-normative and marginalized sexualities and genders (e.g. queer, two-spirit, trans, nonbinary, asexual and more). Theorizing is an activity but also a writing genre. We explore classic and current works in that genre. Finally, we examine the interaction between theory and research practice, via the concept of engaged research, showing that theoretical debates inform more accurate and just research practices. SWGS 100 is recommended but not required. This course counts towards the Requirements (Theory) for the SWGS major and the Requirements (Area of Specialization: Theory) for the SWGM minor. Recommended Prerequisite(s): SWGS 100",

We will explore that fascination in a wide-ranging sample of writing by such authors as Kate Chopin, William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, Walker Percy, Eudora Welty, John Kennedy Toole, Michael Ondaatje, Sarah Broom, Maurice Carlos Ruffin, Eric Nguyen, and others. We will try to understand some of the many ways in which these writers have used this mysterious, complex, and magnetic place, striving to explain its survival despite and in some cases because of the social, legal, cultural, and environmental storms that have battered it. Our reading will be balanced between texts long ago admitted to the canon of classic American literature (Streetcar Named Desire, A Confederacy of Dunces) and texts that are part of a recent remarkable outburst of creative energy associated with the post-Katrina city (Ruffin\u2019s short stories; Sarah Broom\u2019s The Yellow House). The food, drink, and music of New Orleans will receive special attention as key parts of the city\u2019s cultural fabric. A final paper will ask you to write your own New Orleans: to build a verbal monument from the foundations of these other attempts to capture the city\u2019s essence in words.",

In this seminar, we will explore the following topics through literature reviews and group discussions: How fast is sea level rising? How do we predict sea level changes? Why does sea level change? Are there places with sea level dropping and why? What are some complications that Houston has that make rising seas a higher risk? Where and whom are most vulnerable to sea level rise? What are the physical damage and socioeconomic impacts of sea level rise? What can we do to mitigate sea level rise? Can we live in harmony with the rising sea and how do we adapt to it?

Until recently, most algorithms for solving inferential and estimation problems have iteratively applied static models derived from physics or intuition. In this course, we will explore a new approach that is based on \u201clearning\u201d various elements of the problem including i) stepsizes and parameters of iterative algorithms, ii) regularizers, and iii) inverse functions. For example, we will explore a new approach for solving inverse problems that is based on transforming an iterative, physics-based algorithm into a deep network whose parameters can be learned from training data. For a range of different inverse problems, deep networks have been shown to offer faster convergence to a better quality solution. Specific topics to be discussed include: Ill-posed inverse problems, iterative optimization, deep learning, neural networks, learning regularizers. This is a \u201creading course,\u201d meaning that students will read and present classic and recent papers from the technical literature to the rest of the class in a lively debate format. Discussions will aim at identifying common themes and important trends in the field. Students will also get hands on experience with optimization problems and deep learning software through a group project. Repeatable for Credit.",

Students enrolled in ENGL 113 will consider the fundamental questions of the industry: \u201cWhat is literature and who decides?\u201d, What is craft?\u201d, \u201cWhat is poetry and what is the utility of a poem?\u201d, \u201cWhat stories are fiction writers allowed to tell?\u201d, and \u201cWhat is creative nonfiction\u2019s relationship to truth?\u201d Alongside these discussions, students will study the basic elements of literature\u2019s three main genres (poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction), enlarge their understanding of editorial critique, and develop skills for providing feedback in the workshop setting. Several classes throughout the semester will feature discussions with visiting publishers, editors, agents, poets, essayists, and/or novelists. Students will also be asked to become practitioners of \u201cliterary citizenship.\u201d This will come about through weekly attendance at staff meetings of The Rice Review, participation in literary events throughout Houston, and through the hands-on experience of planning and hosting The Rice Review\u2019s annual Fall Open Mic Night. All students will be considered as official staffers for the magazine and will be acknowledged in that year\u2019s annual issue. Course counts toward the English Creative Writing Major Concentration (ECRW). There is no prerequisite for this course, but a joy for reading and debating the qualities of great poetry and prose is strongly encouraged. ENGL 113 is a prerequisite for ENGL 114. For more information about the spring continuation of the course and the production of The Rice Review, please refer to the course description for ENGL 114.",

The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today\u2019s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions. It will also explore fundamentals of the field of Artificial Intelligence through the prism of robotics. The class involves a significant programming project.

These include theoretical computer science (TCS), numerical linear algebra (NLA), statistics, applied mathematics, data analysis, machine learning, etc. As a consequence of the multi-disciplinarity of the area, researchers often fail to appreciate the underlying connections and the significance of contributions developed outside their own area. In this course, rather than focusing on technical details, we will focus on highlighting for a broad, basic linear-algebra-savvy audience, the simplicity and generality of some core linear algebraic ideas. In particular, we will focus on two fundamental and much used matrix problems which have been at the center of recent developments: (1) Least Squares approximation and (2) Low-Rank Matrix Approximation. A key tool for achieving this goal are randomized algorithms which originated in TCS. Cross-list: ELEC 406.",

        "description": "\"Justice in the Food System\" takes an interdisciplinary approach to the critical examination of injustice in the United States food system, drawing from humanities and social science approaches and with special attention to environmental concerns. The overarching goal of this class is three-fold. First, to understand the structure of the US food system and the ways that it is shaped by forms of power rooted in inequalities of race, class, and gender. Second, the course will introduce students to the concept of food justice and some of the key struggles of the food justice movement in the United States, as understood through lenses of land, labor, and agriculture. Third, students will draw from their structural understanding and exposure to varied critical perspectives to envision more just food futures and articulate these through a final project.",
